# skribbly âœŽ

The idea is to have a functioning [Skribbl.io](https://www.skribbl.io) clone.
It will feature a functioning multiplayer mode and most things included in the original game.

## Running

Install all NodeJS Packages with `npm install` or `yarn install`

Compile scss to css using `scss src/style` or `scss -w src/style` to watch for changes

Run `npm start` of `yarn start` to start the web server

Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the project
